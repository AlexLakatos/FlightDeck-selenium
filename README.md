Firefox Addons-Builder Tests
====================

Automated tests for the Firefox Addons Builder web application.

Running Tests
-------------

### Java
You will need a version of the [Java Runtime Environment][JRE] installed

[JRE]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

### Python
Before you will be able to run these tests you will need to have Python 2.6 installed.

Run

    easy_install pip

followed by

    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    
__note__

If you are running on Ubuntu/Debian you will need to do following first

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    
to install the required Python libraries.

### Selenium
Once this is all set up you will need to download and start a Selenium server. You can download the latest Selenium server from [here][Selenium Downloads]. The filename will be something like 'selenium-server-standalone-2.0.jar'

To start the Selenium server run the following command:

    java -jar ~/Downloads/selenium-server-standalone-2.0.jar

Change the path/name to the downloaded Selenium server file.

### Running tests locally
The mozwebqa py.test plugin manages the link to Selenium/webdriver. Pass in the [parameters] for the browser you require.
Place your Mozilla Addons account details into credentials.yaml (but don't check them into github!)

The following command will run all flight deck/builder tests:

    py.test . --browsername=? --browserver=? --platform=? --credentials=credentials.yaml

Example:

    py.test  --browsername=FIREFOX --browserver=7 --platform=MAC --credentials=credentials.yaml --baseurl="https://builder-addons-dev.allizom.org/"
